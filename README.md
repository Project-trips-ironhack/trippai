# TRIPPAI


### Web del Proyecto 👉🏻 https://trippai.herokuapp.com/


Trippai is a travel search web app where you can get recommendations for your next trip based on your preferences. The app will suggest several cities with different plans and itineraries for each of them.

The project is based on the following technologies: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, PassportJS, Handlebars, HTML, CSS, Bulma and some API's like Google Maps, Google Search Box and Cloudinary.

This is the second project developed during Ironhack's bootcamp and was made by José Manuel Henche (https://github.com/JoseMHRuiz) and Arturo Gómez (https://github.com/arturogbruno).
